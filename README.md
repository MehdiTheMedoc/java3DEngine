# Java3DEngine
An attempt to make the use of LWJGL 3D easier

# What's new
the diffuse light seems to work now, but only if the entire scene uses only one shader. Can't figure out why.

# Next things to do
- "noEffects" parameter for main shader, in order to prevent light on skyboxes
- specular light
