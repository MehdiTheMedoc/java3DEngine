# Java3DEngine
An attempt to make the use of LWJGL 3D easier

# What's new
the diffuse light seems to work now, but only if the entire scene uses only one shader. Can't figure out why.
the specular light works too.

added a "effect" toggle parameter in order to virtually use several shaders in one, and avoid the issue.

# Next things to do
- collision detection
- reorganize the code to make it cleaner
